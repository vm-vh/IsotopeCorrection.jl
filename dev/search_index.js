This approach is often more informative than simply measuring \nmetabolite concentrations as it helps to understand how cells respond to different conditions. The stable isotope of carbon, \ncarbon-13 (13C), is commonly used as a tracer in MFA to investigate metabolic fluxes, though other isotopes like nitrogen-15 (15N) \ncan be used. These isotopes do not significantly alter the chemical properties of the molecules they label, making them ideal \nfor tracking metabolic processes. However, naturally occurring isotopes can affect the accuracy of the isotope tracing, \nas their presence interferes with the signals obtained from the isotopically labeled substrates.\n\nWhen conducting isotope labeling experiments, it is critical to distinguish between isotopes introduced into the system \nexperimentally and those naturally present at the start of the experiment. The natural abundance (NA) of stable isotopes can skew \nthe results of isotope labeling studies if not corrected appropriately{1}. For example, carbon naturally exists as \napproximately 98.93% 12C and 1.07% 13C. Ignoring the NA of 13C could lead to errors in the interpretation of metabolic fluxes, \nespecially when using gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GCMS) as the derivitization necessary for gas chromatography leads \nto many more incorporated atoms.\n\nWhile early correction methods were based on the assumption that mass isotopomer distributions (MIDs) of labeled standards were \nsimply shifted versions of the unlabeled standards, it is much more accurate to account for the non-linear distribution of \nstable isotopes, or \"skew,\" caused by isotopic enrichment from experimental tracers. \nThis package implements this “skewed” correction method, using multinomial probability theory to account for the non-linear \ndistribution of naturally occurring isotopes. A least-squares optimization function ensures that fractional abundances remain \npositive after correction is used and corrects for noise, similarly to IsoCor{2}. In addition to correcting for the natural \nabundances of all isotopes, correction for the purity of the tracer substrate is also implemented.\n\n{1}\tMidani, F. S.; Wynn, M. L.; Schnell, S.
